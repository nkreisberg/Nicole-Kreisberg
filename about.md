Nicole has investigated labor market inequalities at a variety of non-profit and governmental agencies in Texas, Illinois, and Massachusetts, where she worked with immigrants, previously incarcerated men, and individuals engaged in protected concerted activity to advocate for equitable working conditions. Immediately prior to enrolling at Brown, she worked as a Senior Research Analyst in Massachusetts, where she published policy-oriented research on immigrants in the labor market. This research received significant media attention, including on the front page of [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/10/09/high-tech-pay-gap-hispanics-asians-african-americans/16606121/). 

Nicole also engages her local geography to make social change. While in Massachusetts, Nicole founded a financial education program for women through a fellowship from [Rosie’s Place](https://www.rosiesplace.org), the first women’s shelter in the United States. In 2017, the program won the [innovation award](https://www.elizabethfreemancenter.org/learn-more/moneyschool/) from the state of Massachusetts Office of Victim Assistance.
