### Research

#### Immigrant Inequality in the Labor Force

Nicole’s primary area of interest centers around immigrant inequalities in the labor force, as well as the socio-legal processes which explain those inequalities. In a paper published in [Social Forces](https://academic.oup.com/sf/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sf/soy128/5320369?redirectedFrom=fulltext), she evaluates whether the legal status categories with which immigrants enter the country stratify their opportunities for labor market integration. Using nationally representative data and propensity score weighting techniques, she finds that immigrants' legal starting points are associated with persistent, ordered differences in immigrants’ occupational positions, even after immigrants change legal status.

In Nicole’s [dissertation](dissertation.md), she focuses on the independent effects of legal status in the labor market. Specifically, she uses a correspondence audit study and a national survey experiment of employers to test whether and why Latinos’ nativity and legal status affect their employment opportunities. This work has been supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?).

#### Gender and Migration

Another area of interest revolves around gender and migration. In a co-authored paper with [Margot Jackson](https://www.brown.edu/academics/sociology/people/margot-jackson) of Brown University, Nicole studies how the intersection of gender and legal status shapes labor market sorting and occupational mobility over time. Using nationally representative data, they find that women experience a 'double disadvantage' in the labor market associated with prior exposure to undocumented status. This disadvantage actually widens over time relative to women who were never undocumented. 

In another co-authored paper with [Elizabeth Jacobs](https://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/content/elizabeth-jacobs) of the University of Pennsylvania, Nicole revisits conventional understanding of gender differences in occupational attainment in the context of highly skilled legal migration to the United States. Drawing on a unique combination of nationally representative data and in-depth interviews with skilled migrants, they find that a U.S. relative to a foreign education has a large premium in the global labor market, and it has the power to mitigate the gender gap in occupational attainment.

#### Educational Inequality

A third area of research concerns inequalities in higher education. In collaboration with [Amy Hsin](https://sites.google.com/view/amyhsin) of Queen’s College, Nicole examines the academic trajectories of undocumented students. The literature on higher education and mobility suggests that high-performing students in high school often experience an upward educational achievement trajectory in college, otherwise known as educational progression. Using administrative data from a large public university, they find that despite strong academic performance in high school, undocumented students experience what they call an educational regression in academic achievement relative to their documented and U.S.-citizen peers over time. They develop a theoretical and empirical framework for describing this unique trajectory.

Nicole's doctoral dissertation research relies on mixed-methods—including a correspondence audit study, a survey experiment, and in-depth interviews with workers and employers—to examine the effects of nativity and documentation status on Latinos’ employment opportunities.
