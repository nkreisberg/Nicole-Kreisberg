### Immigrant Inequality in the Labor Force

Nicole’s primary area of interest centers around immigrant inequalities in the labor force. In a paper published in [Social Forces](https://academic.oup.com/sf/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sf/soy128/5320369?redirectedFrom=fulltext), she evaluates whether immigrants' legal status starting points stratify their opportunities for labor market integration. She finds that immigrants' legal starting points are associated with persistent, ordered differences in immigrants’ occupational positions, even after immigrants change legal status.

In Nicole’s [dissertation](dissertation.md), she focuses on the independent effects of nativity and legal status in the labor market. Specifically, she uses a correspondence audit study, a national survey experiment of employers, and in-depth interviews to test whether and why Latinos’ nativity and documentation status affect their employment opportunities. This work has been supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?).

### Gender and Migration

Another area of interest revolves around gender and migration. In a co-authored paper with [Margot Jackson](https://www.brown.edu/academics/sociology/people/margot-jackson) of Brown University, Nicole studies how the intersection of gender and legal status shapes labor market sorting and occupational mobility over time. She finds that women experience a 'double disadvantage' in the labor market associated with prior exposure to undocumented status. This disadvantage actually widens over time.

In another co-authored paper with [Elizabeth Jacobs](https://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/content/elizabeth-jacobs) of the University of Pennsylvania, Nicole revisits conventional understanding of gender differences in occupational attainment in the context of legal migration to the United States. Drawing on a quantitative and qualitative methods, she finds that a U.S. relative to a foreign education has a large premium in the global labor market, and it has the power to mitigate the gender gap in occupational attainment.

### Educational Inequality

A third area of research concerns inequalities in higher education. In a co-authored paper with [Amy Hsin](https://sites.google.com/view/amyhsin) of Queen’s College, recently published in the [Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies] (https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/ZAHPEDBUTGXIAZGFQPN5/full?target=10.1080/1369183X.2020.1750947), Nicole examines the academic trajectories of undocumented students. She finds that despite strong academic performance in high school, undocumented students experience what she calls an educational regression in academic achievement relative to their documented and U.S.-citizen peers over time. She develops a model for describing this unique trajectory.
